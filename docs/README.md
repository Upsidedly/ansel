# Ansel

Ansel is a dynamic, optionally typed, object-oriented programming concept language. It has no existing compiler, but if it did, it would be a JIT compiler.

It uses syntax inspired by an array of programming languages, as well as original implementations.

Ansel comes with standard libraries out-of-the-box, which include
- [math](libraries/math.md)
- [http](libraries/http.md)

Ansel would have garbage collection, so no need to manually free and allocate memory.
